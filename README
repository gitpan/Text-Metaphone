WARNING!   This module is not yet ready for prime-time!  Play with it, but for 
god's sake, don't put it in any production code.  I'm just throwing it into the
ring to see if I get any reaction.  ("But there were only a few 
flipper-babies!")

Metaphone is an algorithm where-by words (or any string) are transformed into a
rough approximation of its english pronunciation.  Thus you can use it to find
words which sound similar.  The usual application for this is recovering from 
mispellings.

INSTALLATION
The usual drill...

	perl MakeFile.PL   
		or   
	perl MakeFile.PL PREFIX=/path/to/your/home/dir
		then
	make
	make install

No, there are no tests yet.
