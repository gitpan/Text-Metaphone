Heh, what happened to 1.00?  Never existed, it was supposed to be the gamma
release of the pure perl version of the module.  Skipped straight to 1.90, 
alpha XS version.

BTW  The new XS version is about 40x faster than the old perl version. :)

	  it on case-insensitive filesystems. (Thanks Pudge)
